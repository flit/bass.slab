Argon RTOS Todo List
====================

Ideas
-----

√ Refactor list management code.
√ Add constructors and copy constructors.
√ Get global object lists working.
√ Implement timers.
* Implement priority inheritence for mutexes.
* Finish user interrupt support.
√ Clean up member function support for threads.
- Either implement or remove Thread::join().
x More thorough testing using cppunit. [Massive effort to get cppunit compiling under IAR.]
- Unpriveledged support?
x Event flags?
x Invert thread priorities, so that 0 is highest priority? This is the more common arrangement for RTOSes.
√ Floating point support for M4F.
√ Use circular linked lists instead of NULL terminated.
* Use a lock on the scheduler instead of disabling interrupts.
- Handle a thread changing its own priority when it owns a mutex and has been hoisted in priority.
√ Check the IPSR to determine whether it is in an IRQ, so the irq depth doesn't have to be manually adjusted.
√ Sort thread sleeping list by wakeup time.
- Add link from thread to object it's blocked on. (?)
- Make scheduler smart enough to do round robin using beginning of ready list since that list is sorted by priority. i.e., it doesn't need to scan the entire list.
* Support tickless idle.
- High resolution timers. Tickless idle could be used to support timers with resolutions higher than a tick.
- Use MSP for idle thread and timers. (?)
- Handle changing system clock by updating SysTick.
* Proper Cortex-M RTOS support (no IRQ disabling, reduced locking, etc).
x Replace queue with buffered channel?
√ Add an internal utility function to get whether we're in an IRQ; use it instead of checking IRQ depth.
x Use nullptr instead of NULL (provide compatibility macro for pre-C++11).
√ Replace IrqDisableAndRestore class with a more generic kernel lock class that will work for Cortex-M as well as any other system.
* Write an automated test suite.
- Rewrite mutex to not be based on sem. (?)
√ Unblock blocked threads when deleting a queue.
√ Simplify Thread class variants.
* Run main() in a thread.
√ Add option to create threads resumed.
- Have an installable error handler to deal with errors in ctors. (?)
√ armcc support
√ gcc support
- Reduce kernel object sizes as much as possible.
- Make ar_kernel_run() set the current thread to the idle thread so the scheduler doesn't need a special case the first time it is executed.
- Improve thread init and port APIs so the Thread class doesn't require an extra entry point wrapper.
- Add port kernel data struct so the extended frame flag can be included in g_ar. (Really useful?)
- Separate tick timer routine sources so they can easily be replaced by the user.
- Do we even need the suspended thread list?
- Deal with wrapping of tick counter.
- Clean up enter_scheduler() vs ar_port_service_call() usage, switch threads.
√ Save stack bottom instead of top in thread struct?
- Support member function callbacks in Timer.
√ Remove m_createdNode members of kernel object structs if AR_GLOBAL_OBJECT_LISTS is not set.
- Need to be able to restart a thread once it has completed execution.
√ Make _ar_thread_t::block() enter the scheduler itself, to reduce duplicated code. Same with unblockWithStatus() when the unblocked thread is highest priority.
- Move more internal stuff into Ar namespace.
x Consider possibilities of run-to-completion threads that share a stack.
- Add a deferred call mechanism that works from ISRs.
- Channels only need one blocked list.
- Some timer code is included even if timers are not used in the application.
- Reset MSP when kernel starts so there is no wasted stack space.
- Rename _halt() to ar_port_halt_cpu().
- Restore stack size or stack top in thread struct so we can compute stack usage.
- ar_kernel_enter_scheduler() no longer does anything but call ar_port_service_call(). Merge the two.
- Add comprehensive kernel event recording/trace capability.
- Limit channel and queue element size to a single word.
* Add run loops.
- Move code that handles timer one-shot vs periodic from idle thread to new timer invoke() routine.
- Return errors for non-zero timeouts in calls from timers, like for ISRs.
- Normalize channel and queue class send() and receive() methods' use of ptrs, references, or by value.
- Add a header to kernel object structs with type and name pointer?
- Change to a single ar_object_get_name() API?
- Can we replace the ar_list_node_t object pointer member with a calculation of node struct offset from the header of the containing kernel object struct?
x Change function pointer types to not be pointers, then make params etc pointers.
- Remove "m_" from kernel object member names since they are public and accessed directly?
√ Make kernel object class destructors non-virtual, except for Thread; no virtual methods, and this will save a vptr&table for each class.
- Remove "2" on ar_post_deferred_action2() and use overloading.
- Use SVCall for most kernel APIs.
- KernelLock doesn't need a member to store saved state because g_ar.lockCount can be used.
- Have scheduler compute thread CPU usage.
- Remove need for idle thread by staying in scheduler until a thread becomes ready.
- Add support for blocks.
- MPU support.
- 64-bit tick counter.
- Move g_ar.allObjects to its own global variable.
- Add a sleep until API.


Issues
------

x Use of timers requires another stack.
- Timers all share a single stack.
- Idle thread requires a stack.
- Interrupts are disabled to protect kernel objects.
- System load has garbage value if idle thread is only run to invoke timers.
- It's very unintuitive to have default ctor for sem, mutex, channel? not actually init the object.
- Sometimes deferred actions are not being executed as soon as the kernel is unlocked, or the kernel is not being properly unlocked, causing a situation where the deferred action queue can overflow.
- Idle thread will WFI sometimes when we don't want it to, like when running timers back to back.
- Blocking the idle thread will cause the scheduler to assert.


Renaming
--------

ar::thread
ar::thread_with_stack<S>
ar::sem
ar::sem::guard
ar::mutex
ar::mutex::guard
ar::base_chan
ar::chan<T>
ar::tchan<T>
ar::base_queue
ar::queue<T,N>
ar::bufchan<T,N>
ar::timer


Tickless idle
-------------

- Change to higher res than 10 ms.
- Losing bits of time all over the place as we enable and disable the timer.
√ Round robin for threads with the same priority doesn't work.

- Use a two timer model
    - One timer for a µs wall clock
    - Another timer as the wakeup timer


Notes
-----

- need to clear SysTick COUNTFLAG when locking in ar_port_set_lock()?

- kernel locking:
    - don't disable timer
    - instead, make timer isr check if kernel is locked and if so simply record that the timer fired
    - when the kernel is unlocked, check timer fired flag and if set call real timer handler


with virtual dtors:
sizeof(ar_thread_t)=72; sizeof(Thread)=84
sizeof(ar_channel_t)=36; sizeof(Channel)=36

sizeof(ar_mutex_t)=40; sizeof(Mutex)=44
sizeof(ar_queue_t)=56; sizeof(Queue)=60

sizeof(ar_channel_t)=36; sizeof(Channel)=36
sizeof(ar_semaphore_t)=28; sizeof(Semaphore)=28
sizeof(ar_mutex_t)=40; sizeof(Mutex)=40
